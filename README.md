This is a dataset that focuses on occluded vehicle detection.

Based on the [UA-DETRAC](https://detrac-db.rit.albany.edu/) dataset, we obtained the dataset UADETRA-OVD consisting of 8677 images that are abundant in instances of mutual vehicle occlusion and vehicles being occluded by other objects, through IOU threshold filtering and manual labeling.
